## Core Exchange State Machines Diagram
![State Machines](images/Boson_Protocol_V2_-_State_Machines.png)

### Status and intentions of this diagram
* This date stamped diagram reflects the team's _current consensus_ about the state machines making up the protocol's core exchange mechanism.
* The state of the code may be behind or at odds with this diagram; we are _working toward this_ now. 
* Modifications to this diagram should be agreed upon by the team and this diagram updated before building if at possible.
* If confused, _assume this diagram the source of truth_, not the code.
