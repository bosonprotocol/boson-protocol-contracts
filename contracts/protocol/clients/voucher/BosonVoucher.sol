/**
 * @title BosonVoucher
 * @notice This is the Boson Protocol ERC-721 Voucher contract.
 *
 * N.B. Although this contract extends OwnableUpgradeable and ERC721Upgradeable,
 *      that is only for convenience, to avoid conflicts with mixed imports.
 *
 *      This is only a logic contract, delegated to by BeaconClientProxy. Thus,
 *      this contract will never be "upgraded". Rather it will be redeployed
 *      with changes and the BosonClientBeacon will be advised of the new address.
 *      Individual seller collections are clones of BeaconClientProxy, which
 *      asks the BosonClientBeacon for the address of the BosonVoucher contract
 *      on each call. This allows us to upgrade all voucher collections cheaply,
 *      and at once.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Only PROTOCOL-roled addresses can issue vouchers, i.e., the ProtocolDiamond or an EOA for testing
 * - Minted to the buyer when the buyer commits to an offer
 * - Burned when the buyer redeems the voucher
 * - Support for pre-minted voucher id ranges
