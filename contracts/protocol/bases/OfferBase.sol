     * 1. voucher expiration date is either
     *   -  _offerDates.voucherRedeemableUntil  [fixed voucher expiration date] 
     *   - max([commitment time], _offerDates.voucherRedeemableFrom) + offerDurations.voucherValid [fixed voucher expiration duration]
     * This is calculated during the commitToOffer. To avoid any ambiguity, we make sure that exactly one of _offerDates.voucherRedeemableUntil
     * and offerDurations.voucherValid is defined.
     * 2. Checks that include _offer.sellerDeposit, protocolFee, offer.buyerCancelPenalty and _offer.price  
     * Exchange can have one of multiple final states and different states have different seller and buyer payoffs. If offer parameters are
     * not set appropriately, it's possible for some payoffs to become negative or unfair to some participant. By making the checks at the time
     * of the offer creation we ensure that all payoffs are possible and fair.
