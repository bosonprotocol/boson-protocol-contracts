/**
 * @title SnapshotGate
 * @notice Gates Boson Protocol offers with a snapshot of ERC1155 holders.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Maintains a single snapshot, allowing batch append by contract owner until snapshot is frozen.
 * - Self-mints a custodial ERC-721 token for every unique ERC-1155 token id found in the snapshot.
 * - Once a snapshot is frozen, proxies buyer "commit to offer" protocol requests, tracking their commits.
 * - Upon a successful commit, the holder's snapshot token is considered "used".
 * - Once a snapshot holder's balance for a token has been used, they cannot commit to offers gated by that token id again.
 *
 * Out-of-band setup:
 * - Interrogate an ERC-1155, possibly on another chain, noting each token, its holders, and their balances
 * - Call the appendToSnapshot function, uploading an array of Holder structs.
 * - NOTE: You may not be able to upload the entire snapshot in a single transaction.
 * - Once a snapshot has been uploaded via one or more calls to appendToSnapshot,
 *   this contract will hold tokens it self-minted, which will be used to gate the offer.
 * - Create Offers to be gated on the protocol
 *   - The qty available for an offer should match the supply of its corresponding snapshot token
 * - Create Groups on the protocol which
 *   - wrap their corresponding offers
 *   - have a condition that
 *     - expects a specific token (ERC721)
 *     - uses this contract address as the token address
 *     - uses the appropriate snapshot token id for the gated offer
 *     - has maxCommits setting that matches the supply of its corresponding snapshot token
