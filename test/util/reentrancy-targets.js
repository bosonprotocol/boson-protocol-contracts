/**
 * Reentrancy target enumeration helper.
 *
 * Builds the table of TO targets (state-modifying entry points reachable on
 * the diamond) that the reentrancy matrix test attempts to re-enter, by
 * inspecting every facet artifact under `contracts/protocol/facets/`. For
 * each facet we load its compiled artifact ABI and pick every state-modifying
 * function (stateMutability is `nonpayable` or `payable`) EXCEPT those
 * explicitly allowed to be re-entered (see `REENTRY_ALLOWED_NAMES` /
 * `REENTRY_ALLOWED_PATTERNS` below).
 *
 * The artifact ABI is the right source of truth here: Solidity emits every
 * function callable from outside the contract — including those INHERITED
 * from base contracts — with full stateMutability metadata. The matrix would
 * silently lose coverage of any inherited external/public state-modifying
 * function if we walked the facet's own AST nodes instead.
 *
 * Rationale: the matrix is a regression guard. If we only tested functions
 * that already carry `nonReentrant`, the test would silently lose coverage
 * the moment a developer drops the modifier. By testing every state-modifying
 * function and explicitly enumerating the ones meant to allow re-entry, an
 * accidental loss of protection — modifier removed, new function added without
 * a guard, internal delegate exposed — fails the test fast.
 *
 * Functions reachable on the diamond split into:
 *   - those carrying `nonReentrant` directly → guard fires from the modifier;
 *   - those that delegate to another `nonReentrant` function (e.g. orchestration
 *     `*Preminted*` wrappers, batch variants like `completeExchangeBatch` /
 *     `expireDisputeBatch`) → guard fires from the inner call;
 *   - `executeMetaTransaction[WithTokenTransferAuthorization]` → guard fires
 *     from a manual `reentrancyStatus == ENTERED` check inside `_executeMetaTx`
 *     (the modifier can't be used because the meta-tx itself needs to set the
 *     entered status on the inner call).
 *
 * All three patterns block re-entry — the matrix asserts that uniformly.
 *
 * Some orchestration wrappers (`createSellerAnd*With…`) call
 * `createSellerInternal` BEFORE delegating to their inner nonReentrant
 * function. `createSellerInternal` checks `_seller.assistant == _msgSender()`
 * and `_seller.admin == _msgSender()` before any storage writes, so zero-arg
 * calldata reverts at the assistant/admin check long before the inner guard
 * fires — yielding a false-positive "blocked" signal that would NOT detect
 * a regression where the inner delegate's `nonReentrant` is removed (or the
 * delegate is replaced with an unguarded call).
 *
 * To close that hole, those wrappers are listed in
 * `ATTACKER_DEPENDENT_OVERRIDES`. The matrix test calls
 * `rebuildCalldataForAttacker(target, attackerAddress)` at run time to swap
 * `_seller.assistant`, `_seller.admin`, `_seller.treasury`, and
 * `_seller.active` to values that pass `createSellerInternal`'s checks for
 * the specific malicious contract acting as caller in the current FROM block.
 * `createSellerInternal` then succeeds, the wrapper proceeds to call the
 * inner `nonReentrant` function, and the guard fires for real.
